# Twentytwelve WordPress LESS Child Theme
### Sample WordPress Twentytwelve child theme using LESS.

Demo code used for the WordPress NYC Meetup Presentation on 3/18/2014:

[Better WordPress Style: Using SASS & LESS CSS Preprocessors](http://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/events/169583212/)

Yes, it's a 90s style theme, complete with gradients and box shadows, in lovely shades of green. :)

  
The style is identical to the Twentytwelve SASS Child Theme

## Initial Commit
